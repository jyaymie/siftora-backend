# SIFTORA

## üíÑ Project Description

This is the backend of the full-stack application, [Siftora](https://github.com/jyaymie/siftora-frontend).

It follows a RESTful architectural style and has full CRUD functionality with (currently) two tables, 'bins' and 'products', which hold a many-to-many relationship. Here is what you can do with the Siftora API:

| HTTP Verb | URL              | Description               |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| GET       | api/bins         | Retrieve all Bins         |
| GET       | api/bins/:id     | Retrieve a Bin by :id     |
| GET       | api/products     | Retrieve all Products     |
| GET       | api/products/:id | Retrieve a Product by :id |
| POST      | api/bins         | Create a new Bin          |
| POST      | api/products     | Create a new Product      |
| PUT       | api/bins/:id     | Update a Bin by :id       |
| PUT       | api/products/:id | Update a Product by :id   |
| DELETE    | api/bins/:id     | Delete a Bin by :id       |
| DELETE    | api/products/:id | Delete a Product by :id   |

## üë©‚Äçüíª Technologies

This API was built using Python and Django REST Framework (DRF), as well as PostgreSQL (for the database) and Heroku (for deployment).
